# Illusion Engine

Illusion Engine aims to be a powerful 3D game engine developed in C++ and OpenGL. This project plans to provide a comprehensive set of features for game development, ranging from fast 2D rendering to high-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering.

***

## Features

- **Fast 2D Rendering:** Efficient rendering for UI, particles, sprites, and more
- **Scripted Interaction and Behavior:** Enabling dynamic and customizable game elements through native scripting.

### Todo

- **High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D Rendering:** Delivering realistic visuals with support for physically-based rendering (PBR).
- **Level Design and World Building:** Powerful level design tools for creating expansive and detailed game worlds.
- **Animation:** Sophisticated animation tools for creating lifelike character animations.
- **Audio System:** Enabling immersive soundscapes to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Multiplayer Networking:** Networking features and replication system for synchronizing game state across multiple clients.
- *(More features planned for future development)*

## Project Status

Currently in active development, the project is being worked on during my spare time. Progress updates and insights into the development process can be found in the [my personal blog](https://rigellm.github.io).

***

## Getting Started

Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 is recommended, as Illusion is officially untested on other development environments while being focused on a Windows build.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RigelLM/Illusion-Engine.git
```

<ins>**2. Configuring the project:**</ins>

1. Run the **GenProjects.bat** file found in the **Scripts** folder. This will automatically generate the appropriate solution files based on the Visual Studio version installed on the user's computer for their use.
2. That's it! You can run the **Project.sln** file generated in the **Illusion-Engine** folder to view the code.

If changes are made, or if you want to regenerate project files, run **Clean_Up.bat** found in Scripts folder and rerun the **GenProjects.bat** script file in the same folder.
